# Allspark
The project contains:
- [x] Base Smart Contract for Games
- [ ] Token Smart Contracts 
- [ ] Supporting scripts


Current status as of project is that the smart contracts are still developing. It will be completed and deploy in Ethereum foundation network by the end of the month.
All contracts are will be documented, and main information for their usage can be found in the source code documentation after finished.

## Base Smart Contract for Games
**Allspark** is base on Movie Transformers, game plays can own their Transformers (Theoretically more than one). We builds the closed ecosystem with a single currency (Coming soon) for players of online and mobile games.

**Transfomer** trasnfer from Spark, made by name and matrix. The Transfomer's appearance will be based on its "_Matrix_". _Matrix_ is simple â€” it's a 16-digit integer, like: 0376273682284722. Different numbers represent different equipment, shapes, colors, etc.

**Players** can get Transformers for free at first time. You can upgrade your equipment through upgrades `function levelUp(uint _transformerId, uint _fee)` and battles `function fight(uint _transformerId, uint _enemyId)`, and you can also merge with your enemy's matrix.

**Games** will base on Virtual Universe. Players control their Transformers to fight, reward missions, etc.

## Token Smart Contracts 
Allspark token will standard ERC-20 token with 18 decimals.

## Supporting scripts
